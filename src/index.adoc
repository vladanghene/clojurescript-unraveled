== About this book

This book covers the ClojureScript programming language, serves as a detailed guide
of its tooling for development, and presents a series of articles about topics that
are applicable to day-to-day programming in ClojureScript.

It is not an introductory book to programming in that it assumes the reader has
experience programming in at least one language. However, it doesn't assume
experience with _Clojure_ or functional programming. We'll try to include links to
reference material when talking about the theoretical underpinnings of ClojureScript
that may not be familiar to everyone.

Since the ClojureScript documentation is good but sparse, we wanted to write a
compendium of reference information and extensive examples to serve as a
ClojureScript primer as well as a series of practical how-to's. This document will
evolve with the ClojureScript language, both as a reference of the language features
and as a sort of cookbook with practical programming recipes.

You'll get the most out of this book if you:

- are curious about ClojureScript or functional programming and have some programming
  experience;
- write JavaScript or any other language that compiles to it and want to know what
  ClojureScript has to offer;
- already know some Clojure and want to learn how ClojureScript differs from it, plus
  practical topics like how to target both languages with the same code base.

Don't be turned off if you don't see yourself in any of the above groups. We
encourage you to give this book a try and to give us feedback on how we can make it
more accessible.  Our goal is to make ClojureScript more friendly to newcomers and
spread the ideas about programming that Clojure has helped popularize, as we see a
lot of value in them.

== Introduction

[quote, Rich Hickey]
Why are we doing this? Because Clojure _rocks_, and JavaScript _reaches_.

_ClojureScript_ is an implementation of the Clojure programming language that
targets JavaScript. Because of this, it can run in many different execution
environments including web browsers, Node.js, Nashorn (and many other).

Unlike other languages that intend to _compile_ to JavaScript (like TypeScript,
FunScript, or CoffeeScript), ClojureScript is designed to use JavaScript like
bytecode.  It embraces functional programming and has very safe and consistent
defaults. Its semantics differ significantly from those of JavaScript.

Another big difference (and in our opinion an advantage) over other languages is
that Clojure(Script) is designed to be a guest. It is a language without its own
virtual machine that can be easily adapted to the nuances of its execution
environment. This has the benefit that Clojure (and hence ClojureScript) has
access to all the existing libraries written for the host language.

Before we jump in, let us summarize some of the core ideas that ClojureScript
brings to the table. Don't worry if you don't understand all of them right now,
they'll become clear throughout the book.

- ClojureScript enforces the functional programming paradigm with its design
  decisions and idioms. Although being strongly opinionated about functional
  programming it's a pragmatic language rather than pursuing theoretical purity.
- Encourages programming with immutable data, offering highly performant and
  state of the art immutable collection implementations.
- It makes a clear distinction of identity and its state, with explicit constructs
  for managing change as a series of immutable values over time.
- It has type-based and value-based polymorphism, elegantly solving the expression
  problem.
- It is a Lisp dialect so programs are written in the programming language's own
  data structures, a property known as _homoiconicity_ that makes metaprogramming
  (programs that write programs) as simple as it can be.

These ideas together have a great influence in the way you design and implement
software, even if you are not using ClojureScript. Functional programming,
decoupling of data (which is immutable) from the operations to transform it,
explicit idioms for managing change over time and polymorphic constructs for
programming to abstractions greatly simplify the systems we write.

[quote, Rich Hickey]
We can make the same exact software we are making today with dramatically
simpler stuff — dramatically simpler languages, tools, techniques, approaches.

We hope you enjoy the book and ClojureScript brings the same joy and inspiration that
has brought to us.


== Language (the basics)

This chapter will be a little introduction to ClojureScript without assumptions about
previous knowledge of the Clojure language, providing a quick tour over all the
things you will need to know about ClojureScript and understand the rest of this
book.

You can run the code snippets in the online interactive repl:

== Tooling & Compiler

This chapter will cover a little introduction to existing tooling for making
things easy when developing using ClojureScript. Unlike the previous chapter,
this chapter intends to tell different stories each independent of the other.

== Language (advanced topics)

This chapter intends to explain some advanced topics that are part of the language
and that does not fit in the first chapter. The good candidates for this section are
transducers, core protocols, transients, metadata. In summary: topics that are not
mandatory for understand the language.
